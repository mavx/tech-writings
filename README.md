  introduces "quality views" as a method for visualizing the quality and evolution of infrastructural software. 
  This approach, inspired by Edward Tufte's data visualization techniques, employs color-graded diagrams to 
  represent various quality metrics, facilitating better communication with stakeholders about software

  software components more comprehensible, especially to non-technical audiences.
